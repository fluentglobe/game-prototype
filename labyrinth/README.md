## Labyrinth Game 2D

The learner starts with a man at the entrance to a super simple labyrinth. It is only possible to move in one direction. As the learner moves in the labyrinth more choices are possible.



## Movement

The man navigates the labyrinth. At each step there can be 1-3 choices of horizontal movement. Vertical movements can be done by entering stairs going up/down, bridges going over, holes in the road or elevator doors. Regardless the actual visual movement is only 2 dimensional. A variation of the elevator door is the transportation slot where the end of a train/bus/tram/taxi is on the side of the road with an opening. In this case the transport will move outside the tunnel/roads to another part of the map.

## Zooming

The game must be zoomed so the current step and the possible next steps are shown on the screen. These are the pieces that matter and should be big enough to be easy to distinguish.
Additional steps are only shown if the window is bigger than an iPhone 6+

There is no need for zooming in/out automatically or by the user.





###### Draw Next Choices

At an intersection 1-3 choices are drawn.


###### Default Controller

The controller determines the next choices to draw.
